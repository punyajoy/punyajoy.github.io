The current literature on hate speech detection leverages primarily the textual content to find hateful posts and subsequently identify hateful users. However, this methodology disregards the social connections between users. In this paper, we run a detailed exploration of the problem space and investigate an array of models ranging from purely textual to graph based to finally semi-supervised techniques using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that utilize both textual and graph-based features. We run exhaustive experiments on two datasets -- Gab, which is loosely moderated and Twitter, which is strictly moderated. Overall the AGNN model achieves 0.791 macro F1-score on the Gab dataset and 0.780 macro F1-score on the Twitter dataset using only 5% of the labeled instances, considerably outperforming all the other models including the fully supervised ones. We perform detailed error analysis on the best performing text and graph based models and observe that hateful users have unique network neighborhood signatures and the AGNN model benefits by paying attention to these signatures. This property, as we observe, also allows the model to generalize well across platforms in a zero-shot setting. Lastly, we utilize the best performing GNN model to analyze the evolution of hateful users and their targets over time in Gab. ","tags":null,"title":"You too Brutus!

The following section presents a detailed plan for the tutorial:-\n Introduction (15 min)- This section will cover the scentific interest in hate speech and various definitions of hate speech. This section will help you understand the outline and what to take home from this tutorial. Analysis (20 min)- In this section, we analyze the spread of hate speech in online social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Gab etc. We observe that hate speech is spreading through online communities at an alarming rate. These hateful users are well connected among themselves and are reaching a wider audience. This case is more severe in moderation free platforms like Gab, Bitchute etc. The targets of such hate vary. These include the Muslims, Jews, Africans etc. This section is further divided into the following parts  Spread of hate speech Effects of hate speech Targets of hate speech   Detection (20 min)- Hate speech detection is a challenging task. We now have several datasets available based on different criterias language, domain, modalities etc.Several models ranging from simple Bag of Words to complex ones like BERT have been used for the task. The task performance seems to be improving over time, however, there are issues like generalizability, bias and explainability of the models.  Different datasets. This section is further divided into Earlier detection models Current detection models (based on transformers) Multimodal and Multilingual hate speech Hate user detection Challenge: Evaluation, Explainability and Bias   Mitigation (20 min)- To deter the spread of hate speech, organizations have adopted several policies. These include the general policies like deletion of posts and/or accounts, shadow banning to softer approaches like counterspeech. Policies like banning/deletion seem to be effective in some cases, but there are issues of violation of freedom of speech. Recent research have started looking into automated generation of counterspeech as well.  Banning and suspending users Counter speech detection Counter speech generation Challenges: Generation pitfalls, Moderation effects   Road to the future (15 min)- We end this tutorial with covering the summary of the challenges and road to the future for hate speech research.

Due to its popularity, WhatsApp has become a powerful and cheap tool for political campaigning being widely used during the 2019 Indian general election, where it was used to connect to the voters on a large scale. Along with the campaigning, there have been reports that WhatsApp has also become a breeding ground for harmful speech against various protected groups and religious minorities. Many such messages attempt to instil fear among the population about a specific (minority) community. According to research on inter-group conflict, such \"fear speech\" messages could have a lasting impact and might lead to real offline violence. In this paper, we perform the first large scale study on fear speech across thousands of public WhatsApp groups discussing politics in India. We curate a new dataset and try to characterize fear speech from this dataset. We observe that users writing fear speech messages use various events and symbols to create the illusion of fear among the reader about a target community. We build models to classify fear speech and observe that current state-of-the-art NLP models do not perform well at this task. Fear speech messages tend to spread faster and could potentially go undetected by classifiers built to detect traditional toxic speech due to their low toxic nature. Finally, using a novel methodology to target users with Facebook ads, we conduct a survey among the users of these WhatsApp groups to understand the types of users who consume and share fear speech. We believe that this work opens up new research questions that are very different from tackling hate speech which the research community has been traditionally involved in.","tags":null,"title":"Short is the Road that Leads from Fear to Hate: Fear Speech in Indian WhatsApp Groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Punyajoy Saha"],"categories":[],"content":"Our team hate-alert has ranked 1st, 2nd and 1st in offensive language detection in Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam respectively.

While better models for hate speech detection are continuously being developed, there is little research on the bias and interpretability aspects of hate speech. In this paper, we introduce HateXplain, the first benchmark hate speech dataset covering multiple aspects of the issue. Each post in our dataset is annotated from three different perspectives: the basic, commonly used 3-class classification (i.e., hate, offensive or normal), the target community (i.e., the community that has been the victim of hate speech/offensive speech in the post), and the rationales, i.e., the portions of the post on which their labelling decision (as hate, offensive or normal) is based. We utilize existing state-of-the-art models and observe that even models that perform very well in classification do not score high on explainability metrics like model plausibility and faithfulness. We also observe that models, which utilize the human rationales for training, perform better in reducing unintended bias towards target communities.

Hence, we perform the first temporal analysis of hate speech on Gab.com, a social media site with very loose moderation policy. We first generatetemporal snapshotsof Gab from millions of posts and users. Using these temporal snapshots, we compute anactivity vectorbased on DeGroot model to identify hateful users. The amount of hate speech in Gab is steadily increasing and the new users are becoming hatefulat an increased and faster rate. Further, our analysis analysis reveals that the hate users are occupying the prominent positions in the Gab network. Also, the language used by the community as a whole seem tocorrelate more with that of the hateful users as compared to the non-hateful ones.

While Facebook, Twitter, Google have attempted to take several steps to tackle the hateful content, they have mostly been unsuccessful. Counterspeech is seen as an effective way of tackling the online hate without any harm to the freedom of speech. Thus, an alternative strategy for these platforms could be to promote counterspeech as a defense against hate content. However, in order to have a successful promotion of such counterspeech, one has to have a deep understanding of its dynamics in the online world. Lack of carefully curated data largely inhibits such understanding. In this paper, we create and release the first ever dataset for counterspeech using comments from YouTube. The data contains 13,924 manually annotated comments where the labels indicate whether a comment is a counterspeech or not. This data allows us to perform a rigorous measurement study characterizing the linguistic structure of counterspeech for the first time. This analysis results in various interesting insights such as: the counterspeech comments receive much more likes as compared to the noncounterspeech comments, for certain communities majority of the non-counterspeech comments tend to be hate speech, the different types of counterspeech are not all equally effective and the language choice of users posting counterspeech is largely different from those posting non-counterspeech as revealed by a detailed psycholinguistic analysis. Finally, we build a set of machine learning models that are able to automatically detect counterspeech in YouTube videos with an F1-score of 0.71. We also build multilabel models that can detect different types of counterspeech in a comment with an F1-score of 0.60.","tags":null,"title":"Thou shalt not hate: Countering Online Hate Speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three  A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

In this paper, We present the machine learning models developed for the Automatic Misogyny Identification (AMI) shared task at EVALITA 2018. We generate three types of features: Sentence Embeddings, TF-IDF Vectors, and BOW Vectors to represent each tweet. These features are then concatenated and fed into the machine learning models. Our model came First for the English Subtask A and Fifth for the English Subtask B. We release our winning model for public use.","tags":null,"title":"Hateminers: Detecting Hatespeech against Women","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chetan Ralekar","Punyajoy Saha","Tapan K.

Most of the people prefer to read on display devices as compared to the print media. To make the reading experience of the reader pleasant and comfortable, the font designers strive hard to choose suitable typographical properties of the text such as font type, font size etc. Some of the researchers suggest that the typography of the text affects the reading performance of the readers to some extent. However, the research focusing on the effect of typography on the reading behavior of the readers is limited and it is hardly touched upon for the Indian scripts. Therefore, the proposed paper aims to find out the effect of Devanagari font type on the reading performance, especially reading comprehension of the readers. In addition to this, a method to reduce the error in the gaze estimation of the eye tracker is also proposed. In order to understand the reading behavior, an eye tracking experiment is performed on 14 participants asking them to read 22 pages, in 3 different font types, presented on the screen of the eye tracker. The performance of the readers is analyzed in terms of total reading time, comprehension score, number of fixations, fixation duration and number of regressions. Our results show that there is a significant difference in the fixation duration, a number of fixations and the comprehension score, when the same document is read in different font type. Thus, there is a scope for improvement in the reading comprehension, by changing the physical properties of the document without changing its content. These findings might be useful to understand the readers’ preference for the font and to design a proper font type for online reading.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of Devanagari Font Type in Reading Comprehension: An Eye Tracking Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sandipan Sarma","Punyajoy Saha","Jaya Sil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524268800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524268800,"objectID":"652cbc8ea497897780af961dc10f0bd7","permalink":"/publication/iccacp_2018/","publishdate":"2018-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iccacp_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a document classification model using feature learning approach based on semantics of the documents. In the learning phase, basic vocabulary (BV) for each document class consisting of nouns has been created by proposing a novel approach. The classification phase searches unique words in the BVs and if found, the corresponding sentence becomes a basic sentence (BS). A tree with unique words of the BS is inserted in the respective forest. Associated words of the children are used to continue the tree formation process until no new node is generated in the tree. Finally, we assign the test document to a class which has a clearly dominant percentage of sentences in the respective forest. The proposed algorithm is compared with various feature-based classification models and satisfactory performance has been observed.","tags":null,"title":"Document Categorization Using Graph Structuring","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
