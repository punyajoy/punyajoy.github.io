On  the  one  hand,  rigidcensorship  on  social  media  cannot  be  imposed.  On  the  other,  the  freeflow of such content cannot be allowed. Hence, we require efficient abusive language detection system to detect such harmful content in socialmedia. In this paper, we present our machine learning model, HateMon-itor, developed for Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification inIndo-European Languages (HASOC), a shared task at FIRE 2019.We have used Gradient Boosting model, along with BERT and LASERembeddings,  to  make  the  system  language  agnostic.

While Facebook, Twitter, Google have attempted to take several steps to tackle the hateful content, they have mostly been unsuccessful. Counterspeech is seen as an effective way of tackling the online hate without any harm to the freedom of speech. Thus, an alternative strategy for these platforms could be to promote counterspeech as a defense against hate content. However, in order to have a successful promotion of such counterspeech, one has to have a deep understanding of its dynamics in the online world. Lack of carefully curated data largely inhibits such understanding. In this paper, we create and release the first ever dataset for counterspeech using comments from YouTube. The data contains 13,924 manually annotated comments where the labels indicate whether a comment is a counterspeech or not. This data allows us to perform a rigorous measurement study characterizing the linguistic structure of counterspeech for the first time. This analysis results in various interesting insights such as: the counterspeech comments receive much more likes as compared to the noncounterspeech comments, for certain communities majority of the non-counterspeech comments tend to be hate speech, the different types of counterspeech are not all equally effective and the language choice of users posting counterspeech is largely different from those posting non-counterspeech as revealed by a detailed psycholinguistic analysis. Finally, we build a set of machine learning models that are able to automatically detect counterspeech in YouTube videos with an F1-score of 0.71. We also build multilabel models that can detect different types of counterspeech in a comment with an F1-score of 0.60.","tags":null,"title":"Thou shalt not hate: Countering Online Hate Speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Punyajoy Saha","Binny Mathews","Animesh Mukherjee","Pawan Goyal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543881600,"objectID":"fb0df84c6a663b0fe4c42aa0d02fbdf6","permalink":"/publication/evalita_ami_2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/evalita_ami_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"With the online proliferation of hate speech, there is an urgent need for systems that can detect such harmful content.

Most of the people prefer to read on display devices as compared to the print media. To make the reading experience of the reader pleasant and comfortable, the font designers strive hard to choose suitable typographical properties of the text such as font type, font size etc. Some of the researchers suggest that the typography of the text affects the reading performance of the readers to some extent. However, the research focusing on the effect of typography on the reading behavior of the readers is limited and it is hardly touched upon for the Indian scripts. Therefore, the proposed paper aims to find out the effect of Devanagari font type on the reading performance, especially reading comprehension of the readers. In addition to this, a method to reduce the error in the gaze estimation of the eye tracker is also proposed. In order to understand the reading behavior, an eye tracking experiment is performed on 14 participants asking them to read 22 pages, in 3 different font types, presented on the screen of the eye tracker. The performance of the readers is analyzed in terms of total reading time, comprehension score, number of fixations, fixation duration and number of regressions. Our results show that there is a significant difference in the fixation duration, a number of fixations and the comprehension score, when the same document is read in different font type. Thus, there is a scope for improvement in the reading comprehension, by changing the physical properties of the document without changing its content. These findings might be useful to understand the readersâ€™ preference for the font and to design a proper font type for online reading.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of Devanagari Font Type in Reading Comprehension: An Eye Tracking Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sandipan Sarma","Punyajoy Saha","Jaya Sil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524268800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524268800,"objectID":"4f99b0361c9a654268dae15123e17fe6","permalink":"/publication/iccacp_2018/","publishdate":"2018-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iccacp_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a document classification model using feature learning (Coates, Demystifying unsupervised feature learning, 2012) [5] approach based on semantics of the documents. In the learning phase, basic vocabulary (BV) for each document class consisting of nouns has been created by proposing a novel approach. The classification phase searches unique words in the BVs and if found, the corresponding sentence becomes a basic sentence (BS). A tree with unique words of the BS is inserted in the respective forest. Associated words of the children are used to continue the tree formation process until no new node is generated in the tree. Finally, we assign the test document to a class which has a clearly dominant percentage of sentences in the respective forest. The proposed algorithm is compared with various feature-based classification models and satisfactory performance has been observed.","tags":null,"title":"Document Categorization Using Graph Structuring","type":"publication"}]
